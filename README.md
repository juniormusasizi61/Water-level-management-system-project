Water Level Management System

Description

The Water Level Management System is designed to monitor and control the water levels in a reservoir or tank. It provides real-time data on water levels and automates actions based on predefined thresholds to ensure efficient water management.

Features
Real-time Monitoring:<br>
Continuously monitors water levels using sensors and records the data.<br>
Threshold Alerts:<br>
Alerts administrators when water levels exceed or fall below set thresholds through text sms using the sim800L gsm module technology <br>.
Automated Control:<br>
Automatically controls inlets or valves to maintain desired water levels according to the data recorded by the water level sensors<br> .
Historical Data:<br>
Logs and displays historical water level data for analysis on thingspeak iot data visualisation platform in form of line graphs according to the data recorded by the system over time .<br>
User Interface:<br>
Provides a user-friendly interface for system configuration and monitoring where the water levels shall always be displayed on the i2c lcd display and sms alerts shall be sent to screen display mobile phones whenever the water levels exceed the set critical levels range 


Usage

for water level usage patterns we shall use thingspeak.com iot data visualisation platform so you may need to create an account with it if you domt have one.

Dashboard: Upon accessing the cloud platform fir the project, the dashboard displays real-time water level data and status with usage line graphs and time period.
Settings: 
Configure threshold levels, email notifications, and other settings in the code snippets included in the github repository for the different components.
Logs: View historical water level data and system logs for analysis.
